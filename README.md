# Word Guess Game
This is a web browser hangman style game which was made using Vanilla JavaScript.

This game was primarly focused on implementing DOM manipulation and event listeners--specifically with `keyup` events. Considering this being my first ever project made with JavaScript from the ground up, I was able to organize all game code as an object. The only code outside of the object were functions that included event listeners and DOM manipulation in order to navigate through the single page game as well as start the game. 

The theme of the game plays music by Drake where the user will guess what song is playing.
